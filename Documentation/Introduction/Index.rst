Introduction

What does it do?
================

A GDPR tracking consent popup. It asks for approval to include tracking objects (cookies, images or any HTML) and includes the objects when consented.
It enables tracking from the very first page (including referrer). Consents are shown in groups and saved to a cookie.
It provides a stable API to read out consents with JavaScript.


.. _when-is-it-shown:

When is the popup shown to users?
---------------------------------

By default, the popup is shown once on every page load until the user saves the consent status.
The user can close the popup by clicking the area outside in order to read the current page.

When the user saves the consent status, a new cookie `CookieConsent` will be set with the approved cookie groups.

Exceptions are imprint and data privacy statement pages - this is to follow the GDPR's expectation that
those pages shall be easily and directly accessible and should not interfere with a cookie consent banner.
The page UIDs can be set in TypoScript. This also allows to link to these pages directly in the popup.
